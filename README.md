JavaScript Advanced course is designed to help students enhance their skills and knowledge of the JavaScript programming language. This course covers advanced concepts, techniques, and best practices in JavaScript development, including object-oriented programming, asynchronous programming, functional programming, and working with advanced data structures.

The course will also cover advanced topics such as working with browser events, creating and manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM), using AJAX and JSON, and creating advanced user interfaces with libraries like React and Angular.

Students will also learn how to use debugging tools and techniques to identify and fix errors in their JavaScript code. Additionally, they will be exposed to modern development practices such as version control, code organization, and testing.

By the end of the course, students will have a solid understanding of advanced JavaScript programming concepts and will be able to use this knowledge to develop robust, scalable, and maintainable web applications.

## What will you learn in this course?
You can expect to learn the following concepts and skills:
1) Revised the basics of JavaScript, 
2) IntersectionObserver
4) File 
5) Blob 
6) FileReader 
7) Promise
8) Storage APIs
  One can transition from storing data that was only accessible on the client-side in cookies, Now we will use the Storage API, which is made accessible through two global properties, namely localStorage and sessionStorage.
9) In addition to the idea of iterators and generators.

Talking very specifically, at the end of this course you will know:

The sixth primitive type in JavaScript i.e symbols, and how to work with them to get into some internal operations of the language.
The IntersectionObserver API and how to use it in place of scroll events to monitor the appearance of elements into a root element.
What are iterables and how to iterate over them in a very convenient way using the for...of loop.
What are iterators and how to use them to govern the behavior of iteration done by for...of, or otherwise manually.
How to use generators to define infinite sequences and use lazy evaluation to save resources when computing large collections; and even how to combine the results of multiple generators by means of delegation.
How to obtain File objects from file input elements and the drag..drop API; and then retrieve useful information from these File objects.
The ways in which to process File objects by creating objects URLs for them or by reading them using the FileReader API.
What are blobs in JavaScript and how to use the Blob API to create file-like objects.
What's meant by the term 'callback hell' and how the Promise API is provided to mitigate it.
How to shift from storing client-only data in cookies to the Storage API - made accessible via two global properties: localStorage and sessionStorage.
and even more....
